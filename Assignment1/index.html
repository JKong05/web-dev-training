            <p>The rise of anatomical thinking, and therefore the implementation of medical technologies, has shifted medicine away from a patient narrative, centric practice to that in favor of physicians and their newly acquired authority. Medical technology is a multi-faceted term used to label activities “that bring artifacts into existence” and “that put them to use,” (Sandelowski, 2000). In layman’s terms, it is a term used to describe inanimate and animate objects or processes that aid the physician in their understanding of health and medical practice,
                One instance where medical technology supported anatomical thinking was the introduction of Rene Laennec’s stethoscope. Leading up to the beginning of the 19th century, a physician’s diagnosis was based on patient narrative (Resier, 2009) and groundless medical theories such as humoralism (Picard, 2024). The stethoscope addressed and resolved these issues by providing observable (through hearing) data on the internal structure of the body. This accomplished two primary things: the physician now had the professional authority to validate patient narrative and the physician now had an objective method of understanding anatomical phenomenon. This is because the stethoscope would reveal previously imperceivable symptoms of an individual such as “pectoriloquism” (Resier, 2009), causing patients to now know less about their bodies than a physician. Such change in thinking was also supplemented by the stethoscope’s ability to circumvent societal norms involved in situations such as the diagnosis of a female patient.
                Another example of the significant role medical technology has played in anatomical understanding was the advent of trained nurses. Firstly, it is important to note that the diagnostic revolution that accompanied this period was imperative to progressive medicine and healthcare (Sandelowski, 2000). Sandelowski argued that nurses played a role as the “physician’s eyes” and were responsible for recording and acting on information obtained through medical technology. As a result, trust in medicine and the professional authority given to doctors increased because these nurses acted as intermediaries between the patient and the physician. This aid from nurses allowed doctors to entirely focus on understanding disease and providing adequate healthcare
